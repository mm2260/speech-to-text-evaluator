hello jags automotive this is Denise how may I help you today hello Anita have you had your car serviced with us in the past 
great you are a new customer and our service station was recommended to you by Kurt Johnston yes Chris Johnston he has been a good customer of ours for many years 
so you have a two thousand and ten Honda CRV and when you try to start the car it does nothing but click 
if you replace the battery two months ago so there is a new battery 
you said the car always starts after a few tries but it seems to be getting worse 
well it may be the starter that needs to be replaced 
so you have on the car for five years and I've never had to replace the starter 
well I think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we will do a diagnostic test on the electronics to determine what the problem is 
yes we do have one car we can loan out but it is is already reserved for the next two weeks 
we also have a car shuttle service you can use if you need to be dropped off at work after you bring the car in 
what address would you be going to 
yes Northview Electric Company on Arcadia parkway is within our car service location 
it is complementary for the car service but most people offer a tip to the driver for the ride 
my first available opening to look at your Honda CRV would be next Thursday 
it would take approximately four hours to look at the car and then run the diagnostics on it 
we may be able to get the work done in one day but if we have to order parts I cannot guarantee that 
the cost of a new starter for that make and model of your car is one hundred and eighty nine dollars and the labor is approximately two hundred and fifty dollars if there are no other issues with the car 
yes we can check the brakes while we have it up on the left 
the cost to install a set of front or rear brakes will be approximately four hundred dollars for each set of brakes 
with winter coming it is a good idea to have the car checked all over especially with an old older vehicle 
we can schedule you for Thursday October twenty first arriving at seven AM 
is this the number to reach you at two zero one seven two two five six four eight 
okay nida we have you scheduled for a complimentary car service to and from work leaving our service center at seven fifteen AM and picking you up at approximately four fifteen PM from Arcadia parkway 
okay then we will see you next Thursday at seven o'clock AM 
if you need to adjust your appointment please give us twenty four hours notice or you will be charged a fifty dollar service fee 
thank you for calling avis automotive
