hello jake's automotive service station this is danny how may i help you today  (spk1_1)
hello juanita have you had the car serviced with us in the past  (spk1_2)
play you are a new customer and our service station was recommended to you by your friend card johnston  (spk1_3)
yes i know card johnston he has been a good customer of ours for many years  (spk1_4)
you have a 2010 honda crv and on several occasions when you try to start the car it does nothing but fake  (spk1_5)
so you replace the battery two months ago so that is a new battery  (spk1_6)
you thought the battery was bad at first so you went back to elvis automotive store and had them tested the battery again  (spk1_7)
so they're confirmed the battery still good and that is not the problem  (spk1_8)
you said the car always starts after a few tries but it seems to be getting loads  (spk1_9)
is it the original starter  (spk1_10)
so you have on the car for 5 years and never replace the starter  (spk1_11)
cuz i think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we'll do a diagnostic test on the electronics to figure out what the problem is  (spk1_12)
yes we do have a car we can loan out but it is already booked out what we need as of now  (spk1_13)
we also have a car shuttle service you can use if you need to be dropped off at work after you bring the car in  (spk1_14)
what address would you be going to  (spk1_15)
is not electric company on arcadia parkway is golden hour car service location  (spk1_16)
it is complementary into not charge for the car service but most people comparative to the driver for tonight  (spk1_17)
my first available opening to look at your honda crv would be next thursday  (spk1_18)
it would take approximately four hours to look at the car and then run the diagnostics  (spk1_19)
we may be able to get the work done in one day but it will have to order any parts i cannot guarantee that  (spk1_20)
the cost of a new starter for that make and model of your car is one 89 and the labor is approximately 2 50 if there are no other issues with the car  (spk1_21)
yes we can check the brakes while we have it on the left  (spk1_22)
the cost to install a set of front or rear brakes will be approximately 400 for it set of plates  (spk1_23)
with the winter it is a good idea to have the car checked all over especially with an ordertaker  (spk1_24)
