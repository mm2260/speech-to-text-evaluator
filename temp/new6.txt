so you have a 2010 honda crv and when you try to start the car it does nothing but click  (spk1_5)
and to replace the battery two months ago so that is a new battery  (spk1_6)
you start the car always starts after a few tries but it seems to be getting worse  (spk1_7)
while it may be the starter that needs to be replaced  (spk1_8)
so you have owned the car for 5 years and have never had to replace the starter  (spk1_9)
well i think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we will do a diagnostic test on the electronics to determine what the problem is  (spk1_10)

what address would you be going to  (spk1_13)
yes northview electric company on arcadia parkway is within our car service location  (spk1_14)
