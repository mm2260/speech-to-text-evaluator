you have a 2010 honda crv and on several occasions when you try to start the car it does nothing but fake  (spk1_5)
so you replace the battery two months ago so that is a new battery  (spk1_6)
you thought the battery was bad at first so you went back to address automotive store and have them tested the backfield game  (spk1_7)
zodiac inform the battery still good and that is not the problem  (spk1_8)
you said the car almost starts after a few tries but it seems to be that holds  (spk1_9)
well it may be the starter that needs to be replaced is it the original starter  (spk1_10)
so you have owned the car for 5 years and never replace the starter  (spk1_11)
cuz i think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we'll do a diagnostic test on the electronics to figure out what the problem is  (spk1_12)
yes we do have a car we can loan at work but it is already booked out for two weeks as of now  (spk1_13)
we also have the car shuttle service you can use if you need to be dropped off at work after you clean the car  (spk1_14)
what address would you be going to  (spk1_15)
north electric company on arcadia parkway is golden hour car service location  (spk1_16)
it is complementary into not charge for the car service but most people comparative to the driver 45  (spk1_17)
my first available opening to look at your honda crv with me next thursday  (spk1_18)
to take approximately four hours to look at the car and then run the diagnostics  (spk1_19)
