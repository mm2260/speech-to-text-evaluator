hello jake's automotive service station this is denise how may i help you today  (spk1_1)
hello anita have you had the car serviced with us in the past  (spk1_2)
great you are a new customer and our service station was recommended to you by a friend  kkurt johnston  (spk1_3)
yes i know kurt johnston he has been a good customer of ours   for many years  (spk1_4)
you have a 2010 honda crv and on several occasions when you try to start the car it does nothing but click  (spk1_5)
so  you replaced the battery 2 months ago so that is a new battery  (spk1_6)
 you thought the battery was bad at first so you went back to avis automotive store and had them test the battery again  (spk1_7)
so they confirmed the battery is still  good and that is not the problem  (spk1_8)
you said the car always starts after a few tries but it seems to be getting worse  (spk1_9)
well it may be the starter that needs to be replaced is it the original starter  (spk1_10)
so you have owned the car for 5 years and have never replaced the starter  (spk1_11)
well i think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we will do a diagnostic test on the electronics to figure out what the problem is  (spk1_12)
yes we do have one car  we can loan out but it is already booked out for 2   weeks as of now  (spk1_13)
we also have a car shuttle service you can use if you need to be dropped off at work after you bring the car in  (spk1_14)
what address would you be going to  (spk1_15)
yes northview electric company on arcadia parkway is within our car service location  (spk1_16)
it is complementary we do not charge for the car service but most people offer a tip to the driver for the ride  (spk1_17)
  my first available opening to look at your honda crv would be next thursday  (spk1_18)
it would take approximately 4   hours to look at the car and then run the diagnostics  (spk1_19)
 we may be able to get the work done in one day but if we have to order any parts i can not    guarantee that  (spk1_20)
the cost of a new starter for that make and model of   your car is  189 dollars and labor is approximately ** 250 dollars if there are no other issues with the car  (spk1_21)
  yes we can check the brakes while we have it on the lift  (spk1_22)
the cost to install a set of front or  rear brakes will be approximately 400 dollars for each set of brakes  (spk1_23)
with winter   coming it is a good idea to have the car checked all over especially with an older vehicle  (spk1_24)
we can schedule you for thursday october 21st arriving at 7:00 am  (spk1_25)
is this the number to reach you at 2017225648  (spk1_26)
