hello jake's automotive service station this is denise how may i help you today  (spk1_1)
hello anita have you had the car serviced with us in the past  (spk1_2)
great you are a new customer and our service station was recommended to you by a friend card johnston  (spk1_3)
yes i know card johnston has been a good customer of ours for many years  (spk1_4)
you have a 2010 honda crv and on several occasions when you try to start the car it does nothing but cake  (spk1_5)
so you replace the battery two months ago so that is a new battery  (spk1_6)
you thought the battery was bad at first so you went back to avery's automotive store and had them tested the battery again  (spk1_7)
so they confirm the battery still good and that is not the problem  (spk1_8)
you said the car always starts after a few tries but it seems to be getting orders  (spk1_9)
well it may started that needs to be replaced is it the original starter  (spk1_10)
so you have owned the car for 5 years and never replace the starter  (spk1_11)
but i think you should make an appointment to bring it in and we'll do a diagnostic test on the electronics to figure out what the problem is  (spk1_12)
yes we do have a car we can loan out but it is already booked out for two weeks as of now  (spk1_13)
we also have a car shuttle service you can use if you need to be dropped off at work after you bring the car in  (spk1_14)
what address would you be going to  (spk1_15)
yes north electric company on arcadia parkway is other than our car service location  (spk1_16)
it is complementary we do not charge for the car service but most people don't for a tip to the driver for tonight  (spk1_17)
my first available opening to look at your honda crv would be next thursday  (spk1_18)
to take approximately four hours to look at the car and then run the diagnostics  (spk1_19)
we may be able to get the work done in one day but if we have to order any parts i cannot guarantee that  (spk1_20)
the cost of a new starter for that make and model of your car is one 89 and the labor is approximately 2 50 if there are no other issues with the car  (spk1_21)
yes we can check the brakes while we have it on the left  (spk1_22)
the cost to install a set of front or rear brakes will be approximately 400 for its set of brakes  (spk1_23)
with the winter it is a good idea to have the car checked all over especially with an older vehicle  (spk1_24)
we can schedule for thursday october 21st arriving at 7 am  (spk1_25)
is this the number to reach you at 2017225648  (spk1_26)
we have you scheduled for our complimentary car service to and from work leaving our service center at 7:15 am and picking you up at approximately 4:15 pm from the arcadia parkway  (spk1_27)
